# Scottish Summit 2024

This repository contains the Power Apps Canvas app that I used during my session at the Scottish Summit 2024. You can download [the solution](./NamedFormulaExplorer_1_0_0_3.zip) and easily import it into your environment to explore its features. I've also included a [list of parameters](./Parameters.xlsx) used by the app. To get started, just copy the values from the provided .xlsx file into the appropriate Dataverse table included in the solution.

Enjoy!
